# Capture The Ether
My notes and solutions to the [Capture the Ether](https://capturetheether.com/challenges/) challenges.

Capture the Ether is a game created by [Steve Marx](http://about.smarx.com/). The name is a portmanteau of the popular computer security competition 'Capture the Flag' and the cryptocurrency 'Ether'. This game is a great hands-on learning tool to get a more in-depth understanding of the Ethereum blockchain. Despite the steep learning curve, I highly recommend it to springboard into the world of crypto.

The target audience for this walk-through is anyone that prefers hands-on learning, has some prior development experience, and would like to use this game as a tool to learn about Ethereum and Solidity from scratch. I hope to eventually structure each solution into three sections: a brief run-through of required concepts, a list of further reading, and a solution. This is a work in progress so some solutions may be present without the brief run-through or list of further reading... at least until I find the time to do so. I chose this format for two reasons. The first reason is to provide you with the right tools for the job in hopes that you can solve it on your own before ruining the challenge for yourself. The second is a bit more selfish because I wrote this tutorial to review my own solutions and to summarize my notes on the concepts that were involved. 

Capture the Ether has several sections, and each section has a theme. The challenges get harder as you progress through each theme. The difficulty of each challenge isn't illustrated by the length of code but by the points awarded upon completion of a puzzle. Puzzles award between 50 and 2000 points each. As of August 2018, the game is complete when a player has earned 11600 points from a total of 20 challenges.
